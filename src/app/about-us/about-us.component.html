    <h2 class="title">Project Background</h2>
    <p>The increasing reliance on digital resources has reshaped the way we access information, yet many students 
      and faculty at King Khalid University still face challenges in accessing diverse educational and literary resources
      due to limited libraries within the colleges. This project was conceived to address these barriers by creating an accessible
      digital platform that allows users to easily search for and discover books.
      The e-library platform offers an environment where readers, researchers, and educators can access a variety of 
      reading materials and academic resources, enhancing the educational experience and promoting the love of reading. 
      By leveraging the power of digital technology, we aim to empower individuals to expand their knowledge and engage with 
      books in a way that is convenient and easily accessible.</p>
